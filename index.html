        <h2> About me </h2>

        <p>
            Computer Science was a subject I had picked on a whim for my A-Levels back in College 2014. I was captivated by the nature of programming,
            decomposing problems into lines of code and the potential problem solving that could be achieved through coding. In 2016, I achieved an A* in
            Computer Science, as well as being one of the top 50 candidate results in the country for AQA Computer Science. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Thereafter, I had completed
            two years of studies at UCL, where my journey took an unexpected turn. In 2018, I faced a series of mental health challenges that prompted me
            to temporarily step away from my studies. During this period, I worked as a Security Officer at Barking Station, gaining valuable life experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2019, I made the determined decision to return to academia, enrolling in the Computer Science program at Brunel University. There, I had met a whole 
            array of wonderful friends and slowly grew out of my introverted personality. There, I had managed to achieve an Academic Excellence 
            Scholarship, as well as the opportunity to be an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, allowing me to graduate in 2022 with First class honours.

        <h2> University Projects </h2>

        <h3> Business Process Automation </h3>
        <p>
            Collaborated with a midsized enterprise facing significant challenges
            due to numerous manual workflows. In response, I undertook the task of developing an E-Commerce interface that seamlessly integrated
            with the company's existing ERP system, Xero. Additionally, I dedicated efforts to identifying and implementing automation solutions
            for various customer service processes within the organization. The solution was integrated using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Xero API,
            OAuth2 and Eureka.

        <h3> Worly - Environmental Quiz</h3>
        <p>
            An environmental website allowing users to take quizzes and estimate their carbon footprint, implemented as an academic assignment. 
            Implemented using Spring Boot, JPA and Thymeleaf for page rendering. The websites allow users to login as regular users, or 
            administrators. Administrators are able to create new quiz templates, consisting of questions, answers and scores. Users are then able to
            login and answer these quiz templates to achieve a score. These scores help capture a user's carbon footprint depending on the answers 
            they have chosen, as well as showing the quiz results on how users can better improve their score and hence their carbon footprint.

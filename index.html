                    <h2> About me </h2>

                    <p>
                        Computer Science was a subject I had picked on a whim for my A-Levels back in College 2014. In 2016, I achieved an A* in
                        Computer Science, as well as being one of the top 50 candidate results in the country for AQA Computer Science.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I had completed
                        two years of studies at UCL, but in 2018, I faced a series of mental health challenges that prompted me
                        to temporarily step away from my studies. During this period, I worked as a Security Officer at Barking Station, gaining valuable life experience.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2019, I made the decision to return to academia, enrolling in the Computer Science program at Brunel University. There, I had met a whole
                        array of wonderful friends and slowly grew out of my introverted personality. There, I had managed to achieve an Academic Excellence
                        Scholarship, as well as the opportunity to be an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, allowing me to graduate in 2022 with First class honours.

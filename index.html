            <h2> About me </h2>

            <p>
                Computer Science was a subject I had picked on a whim for my A-Levels back in College 2014. I was captivated by the nature of programming,
                decomposing problems into lines of code and the potential problem solving that could be achieved through coding. In 2016, I achieved an A* in
                Computer Science, as well as being one of the top 50 candidate results in the country for AQA Computer Science.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thereafter, I had completed
                two years of studies at UCL, where my journey took an unexpected turn. In 2018, I faced a series of mental health challenges that prompted me
                to temporarily step away from my studies. During this period, I worked as a Security Officer at Barking Station, gaining valuable life experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2019, I made the determined decision to return to academia, enrolling in the Computer Science program at Brunel University. There, I had met a whole
                array of wonderful friends and slowly grew out of my introverted personality. There, I had managed to achieve an Academic Excellence
                Scholarship, as well as the opportunity to be an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, allowing me to graduate in 2022 with First class honours.

            <p>
                Collaborated with a midsized enterprise facing significant challenges
                due to numerous manual workflows. Developed an E-Commerce interface that seamlessly integrated
                with the company's existing ERP system, alongside an AI chatbot to automate
                various customer service processes. The solution was integrated using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, Xero API, Kommunicate,
                OAuth2 and Eureka.

            <h3> Multithreaded Bank Application | December 2022</h3>
            <p>
                A concurrent bank application designed to handle three client connections and their respective bank accounts. Transactions were a
                simple add, subtract and transfer. Utilised Java Sockets and Mutual Exclusion locks to ensure operations did not suffer from concurrency
                problems such as Lost-Update, Temporary Update and Dirty Reading.

            <h3> Worly - Environmental Quiz | Septermber 2020 - June 2021</h3>
            <p>
                An environmental website allowing users to take quizzes and estimate their carbon footprint, implemented as an academic assignment.
                Implemented using Spring Boot, JPA and Thymeleaf for page rendering. Administrators are able to create new quiz templates, consisting
                of questions, answers and scores. Users are then able to
                login and answer these quiz templates to achieve a score. These scores help capture a user's carbon footprint depending on the answers
                they have chosen, as well as showing the quiz results on how users can better improve their score and hence their carbon footprint.

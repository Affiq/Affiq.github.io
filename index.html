            Computer Science was a subject I had picked on a whim for my A-Levels back in College 2014. I was captivated by the nature of programming,
            decomposing problems into lines of code and the potential problem solving that could be achieved through coding. In 2016, I achieved an A* in
            Computer Science, as well as being one of the top 50 candidate results in the country for AQA Computer Science.

            Thereafter, I had completed
            two years of studies at UCL, where my journey took an unexpected turn. In 2018, I faced a series of mental health challenges that prompted me
            to temporarily step away from my studies. During this period, I worked as a Security Officer at Barking Station, gaining valuable life experience.

            In 2019, I made the determined decision to return to academia, enrolling in the Computer Science program at Brunel University. There, I had met a whole 
            array of wonderful friends and slowly grew out of my introverted personality, allowing me to graduate in 2022 with First class honours.

            For my final year of study, I collaborated with a midsized enterprise facing significant challenges 
            due to numerous manual workflows. In response, I undertook the task of developing an E-Commerce interface that seamlessly integrated 
            with the company's existing ERP system, Xero. Additionally, I dedicated efforts to identifying and implementing automation solutions 
            for various customer service processes within the organization.
